- First, add folders 'Algorithms', 'CEC2014 functions' and 'Classical functions' to the path.
- To compare WFS with similar algorithms just run the file 'CompareAlgorithms.m'. All settings may be adjust there.
- Complete implementation of WFS algorithm is located in Algorithms -> 'WingsuitFlyingSearch.m'.
